Java has numerous linters, such as Checkstyle, PMD and Uncrustify. Checkstyle one of the most popular linters for Java. PMD is another popular linter. Uncrustify is a linter that modifies code in an automated fashion.

Java also has many testing frameworks available, such as Katalon, JUnit and TestNG. Katalon is a popular closed source Testing framework. JUnit is a unit testing framework. TestNG is similar to JUnit but with some improvements.

The most essential Java build tools are Apache Maven, Gradle, and Apache Ant. Maven is used mostly in the corporate world because it aptly handles depencies for example. Gradle is especially used in Android development due to being performant, for one. Ant is less modern and can't on its own handle dependencies but is more customizable.

Java has several CI alternatives, such as gitlab CI/CD, TeamCity and CircleCI. Gitlab CI/CD offers many features and works with Maven and Gradle. TeamCity is popular and has an easy-to-use interface but isn't as easy to set up for large teams. CircleCI is easy to use and works with GitHub, for one.

Gitlab CI/CD and CircleCI are both mainly designed to be cloud-based though can also be self-hosted. TeamCity is both cloud-based and self-hosted, though there can be some hassle self-hosting it. On the other hand, self hosting may be the way to go if one wants to ensure information security, have better performance or save on costs.
